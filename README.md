run_analysis.R: downloads all the required files to complete this assignment and creates a big file mean_and_std.txt and a small file tidy_dataset.txt (both are stored in /results)

- downloads required data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip I found problems using SSL (https) and I decided to use http instead (method="curl" ommited).
- unzips the file if it has not been uncompressed
- creates results folder if it does not exist (all files are stored in this folder)
- loads features.txt used for columns
- loads X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt
- X_train contains the data using the feature data set as columns
- y_train contains the activity labels
- subject_train contains the ids loads and appends test dataset using X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt
- X_test contains the data using the feature data set as columns
- y_test contains the activity labels
- subject_test contains the ids
- appends train and test data
- rearrange the data using id
- loads activity_labels.txt
- changes the data activity row to use the activity labels
- saves the mean and std into results/mean_and_std.txt
- saves the tidy dataset into results/tidy_dataset.txt
